# Mini-Project for Scheduling & project engineering

As students of industrial engineering at Taif University, we look forward to improving the image of the Taif city to become an attractive city for tourists and investors from inside and outside the Kingdom, and we can achieve this goal by searching for the most popular places in our city and making a short advertising video about one of these places for a duration Ranging between 2-4 minutes.

In this project, we will work in a team consisting of 5 members, so we will apply what was learned in the course "Scheduling and Project Engineering" to produce the advertising video in a pre-planned manner, and we hope that our project increases the visibility of the place for all tourists, and the video achieves the desired goals successfully.
